CODE    SEGMENT ;Segment Declaration

ASSUME CS:CODE,DS:CODE ;Assume CODE As CS(Code Segment)-->Directly Loaded(Along With SS)
;And DS(Data Segemnt)-->Not Loaded(Along With ES)

N1 DW 9999H;User Defined N1 Variable Which Is Word Type Has 9999H Value
N2 DW 8888H;User Defined N2 Variable Which Is Word Type Has 8888H Value
N3 DD ?;;User Defined N3 Variable Which Is Dobule Type(4 Byte) Has No Value

;For Initializing Data Segment
START:  MOV AX,CODE ;Storing Offset Address Of Code In AX
MOV DS,AX ;Moving Address OF Code To DS To Load Data Segment

MOV AX,N1
MUL N2 ;Directly Multiplies N2 With AX Which Has Value Of N1

;We Will Be Using Pointer For Storing 32 Bit Data
;Alternatively We Can Store It In 2 Diffrent Segments
MOV SI,OFFSET N3;We Can Either Use BX,SI,DI As Pointer For Indirect Addressing Mode
MOV [SI],AX;Storing Lower Value Of Product In N3
MOV [SI+2],DX;Storing Upper Value Of Product In N3

;Terminating DOS?? Function By Making AX=4C00H
;09H Display Screen Function
MOV AX,4C00H ;Replacing Value At AX With 4C00H
INT 21H ;Interrupt Function
