CODE    SEGMENT ;Segment Declaration

ASSUME CS:CODE ;Assume CODE As CS(Code Segment)-->Directly Loaded(Along With SS)

START:  MOV AX,9999H ;Making AX = 9999H Since In Multiplication Both Operands Cannot Be Direct Values
MOV BX,8888H ;Making BX = 8888H Since In Multiplication Both Operands Cannot Be Direct Values

MUL BX ;Why????

MOV BX,AX ;Stores Answer In BX <Lower Data Value> And DX <Higher Data Value>

;Terminating DOS?? Function By Making AX=4C00H
;09H Display Screen Function
MOV AX,4C00H ;Replacing Value At AX With 4C00H
INT 21H ;Interrupt Function

CODE    ENDS

END START

;We Need Only One Register To Store The Data Since A*B=B*A
;Direct Data Value As Source Operand Is Not Allowed(Immideate Addressing Mode>

;INPUT
;First Input Must Be In AL And Second As Source Operand(8-Bit)
;First Input Must Be In AX And Second As Source Operand(16-Bit)

;OUTPUT
;8-Bit : AX Is Used -->16-Bit ANSWER
;16-Bit ; DX(Upper Value Is Stored Here> And AX(Lower Value Is Stored Here> Both Are Used -->32-Bit ANSWER
